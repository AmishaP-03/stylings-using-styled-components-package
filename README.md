Styling react components using the third party package 'styled-components'.

The package 'styled-components' let us create special components on which we can define our desired styles, instead of defining them in separate CSS files or as inline styles. 

These special components can be re-used wherever required and thus it serves the purpose of limiting the scope of CSS styles to the components in which are defined.
