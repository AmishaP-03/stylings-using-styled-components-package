Styling react components using the third party package 'styled-components'.

The package 'styled-components' let us create special components on which we can define our desired styles, instead of defining them in separate CSS files or as inline styles. 

These special components can be re-used wherever required and thus it serves the purpose of limiting the scope of CSS styles to the components in which are defined.

NOTE: Components created using styled-components forward all props being set on them to the underlying built-in JSX element.

ADVANTAGES:

1. Allows CSS styles to be re-used unlike inline styles
2. They are still defined outside of JSX code, hence proper demarcation is maintained
